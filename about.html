<div id="info">
Originally from the PNW, I've lived in New Orleans for almost six years. I went to Loyola University where I got a degree in Economics - I love data (and in particular, NBA data). I also play guitar in this <a href="http://babesuniverse.net">band</a>, as well as trombone in <a href="http://www.quintronandmisspussycat.com/marchingband.html">this one.</a> Feel free to <a href="/contact">drop me a line</a> if you want to talk about stats, music, or web art!
