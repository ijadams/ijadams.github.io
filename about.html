<div id="info">

Originally from the PNW, I've lived in New Orleans for almost six years. I moved to New Orleans to attend Loyola University where I got a degree in Economics. In these years I've found myself in all different kinds of marketing and multimedia roles. I'm always looking for ways to combine my love of analytics and creative design. In my free time I code, play guitar in this <a href="http://babesuniverse.net">band</a>, and play trombone in <a href="http://www.quintronandmisspussycat.com/marchingband.html">this one.</a><br>

Feel free to <a href="/contact">drop me a line</a> if you want to talk about web design, stats, music, or art!
