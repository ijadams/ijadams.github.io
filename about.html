<div id="info">

Originally from the PNW, I've lived in New Orleans for almost eight years. I moved to New Orleans to attend Loyola University where I got a degree in Economics. I currently work as a Sr. Software Engineer for GE Aviation. In these years I've found myself in all different kinds of marketing and multimedia roles. I'm always looking for ways to combine my love of art and technology. In my free time I code, play guitar in a few groups, and play trombone in <a href="http://www.quintronandmisspussycat.com/marchingband.html">this marching band.</a><br>
