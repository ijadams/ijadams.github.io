Some fun stuff I did over the weekend. Check it out <a href="http://ec2-35-171-26-187.compute-1.amazonaws.com/lilsubbies">here</a>.

UPDATE: After playing at SXSW in Austin for a week, I went and made this torta edition <a href="http://ec2-35-171-26-187.compute-1.amazonaws.com/lilsubbies/torta">here!</a> Also was messing around with the Paper JS animation library while I was thinking about <a href="http://ec2-35-171-26-187.compute-1.amazonaws.com/lilsubbies/cuban">cubans</a>.
