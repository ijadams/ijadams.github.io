<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>This was my first time using Sketch. I've always used Adobe CS for wire-framing/storyboarding, but after hearing good thing about Sketch 3 I decided to give it a try. </p>

<h3>Pros</h3>
<p>Sketch seems like a simplified version of Illustrator but utilizes the layer component of Photoshop. This makes it really easy for non-designers to pickup and communicate their ideas quickly. The focus on development is Sketch's strength - provided you are actually designing for web. I was immediately impressed with the amount of resources Sketch provides. The presets and assets designed specifically for Material Design, iOS, Android, and various screen sizes and devices can save a lot of time when creating mocks or wireframes. In addition, exporting to 2x for retina display users is super easy in Sketch.</p>

<h3>Cons</h3>
<p>The biggest negative of Sketch 3 is it's comparability with Adobe CS. When exporting in Sketch you are dealing with .sketch files which can be a nightmare when Adobe is expecting an .svg file. The lack extensive SVG support in Sketch is a pretty big downside.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Iâ€™d recommend Sketch to any UX designers or developers that don't want to get too crazy with Adobe. It's open source assets, easy interface, and artboard management make it pretty easy to pick up and feel productive. If you come from a design background it is probably easier to just stick with Illustrator, but if you're like me and want to take advantage of as many pre-made assets as possible, Sketch 3 can be a god send.</p>

<p>After drafting and designing an endless amount of different icons we felt accurately described the company's mission. The result is a logo and set of letters that picks up on the playful nature of ROM as well as the professionalism of the student musicians:</p>
