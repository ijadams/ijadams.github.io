As part of this year's <a href="http://www.prospectneworleans.org/p3plus/">Prospect New Orleans</a>, I built a site for one of the many galleries featured in the event. Janet Levy is a great art creator and curator who asked me for help building a site to showcase her exhibition. The exhibition was based in the Free Mason's temple on Rampart. The building was super spooky and cool, and served as a great place to hold on art exhibition. As for the site, I used a simple responsive grid and Lokesh Dhakar's Lightbox JS to make a simplistic one page representation of the gallery. <a href="http://janetlevyprojects.com">Here</a> is what the finished site looks like...Excited to do more work again next Prospect!
