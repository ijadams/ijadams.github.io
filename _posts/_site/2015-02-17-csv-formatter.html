<p>For this project, I wanted to automate a business process that I found particularly annoying at my old position. Hootsuite is a social media application that allows you to schedule social media posts in bulk and across different platforms. Our company was doing a lot of manual scheduling on HS, and not taking full advantage of the bulk uploading component that allows you to upload CSVs of posts. In order to increase efficiency, I decided to make a tool that would reformat our social media posts spreadsheets to conform to Hootsuite’s bulk uploader standards. This meant a lot of parsing of CSVs and nested arrays. I was able to use <a href="http://papaparse.com">PapaParse JS</a>, which was extremely helpful and fast. Papaparse does a lot of cool stuff and coming from an Econometrics background, it’s a great way to parse data and display in it nice ways.
