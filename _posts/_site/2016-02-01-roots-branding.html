<p>Being a member of a marching band since I was 12 years old, I was thrilled when the The Roots of Music asked me to work with them. ROM is a non-profit that focuses on providing music education, academic support, and mentorship for New Orleans youths. </p>

<p>Ever since ROM first launched they have a identified with a seal that represented the organic mission of the organization. It served them well for their first few years, but as they grew and evolved they needed something that would be distinctive, easily consumed, and remembered. </p>

<p>After drafting and designing an endless amount of different icons we felt accurately described the company's mission. The result is a logo and set of letters that picks up on the playful nature of ROM as well as the professionalism of the student musicians:</p>

<p>
The SMART principles of good logo design are:
</p>
<ul style="padding-left:20px;">
<li>Simple</li>
<li>Memorable</li>
<li>Appropriate</li>
<li>Resizable</li>
<li>Timeless</li>
</ul>
<p>
This sounds easier said then done. Building an effective logo takes a lot of elbow grease. Play into your strengths and try to minimize your weaknesses.

Just for fun, here's an alternate version that will be used for apparel:
