Designing email templates is a pretty brutal endeavor. I really enjoy retro web aesthetics, but I still try to avoid working with tables at all costs. My first experience with web design was during my internship at World Trade Center New Orleans. A large part of their marketing efforts were based on their MailChimp email campaigns. Admittedly, when I offered to code a custom email template I really didn’t know what that entailed. Needless to say, I quickly developed a distaste for web design. That was a few years ago and now I love web design, but that project really made me think about going into sales or something.This week I had the chance to do a custom email template for a client. Having experienced the frustration of this kind of work in the past, I wanted to make sure I got my head straight before starting. Here’s a few resources that I found really helpful:

MailChimp’s <a href=“http://templates.mailchimp.com/resources/email-client-css-support/“>Email Client CSS Support Chart</a>. It’s important to know what you can and can’t do in different browsers and email clients. Media queries are awesome, but when working with emails they should only enrich the content - not be integral to it. If your email’s content relies on media queries, you risk losing out on a lot of engagement with your mailing list. 

Another great resource is <a href=“https://litmus.com/blog/“>Litmus’ Blog</a>. Litmus is the email equivalent to BrowserStack and their blog is a goldmine of useful email design tips. Litmus also has a lot of great templates that are a good place to start when designing your own. I actually got to demo the Litmus software, and it worked pretty well. Almost all of my actual device displays were accurate to the emulator’s.

Anyways, emails can rule if you do them right. Emails are very personal, and having someone’s email address is the ultimate digital currency. Other platforms have intrinsic value systems that can distract the user from your message. Emails are personal. They really allow for the user to be submerged in a world that the content creator produces.
