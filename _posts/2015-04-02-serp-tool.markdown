I started out adaptina php library I found on Github in hopes of finding an automatic solution. Unfortunately, Google doesn't offer a search API and is hip to restricting automated requests. This makes it really hard to search for a large list of terms without burning through a ton of proxies. Ultimately, it ended up being better to go with a semi-automatic Chrome extension and user script.
